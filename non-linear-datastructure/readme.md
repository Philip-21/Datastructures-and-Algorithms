# Trees
 It is a DSA that consist of nodes connected by edges.

## Tree Terms
1. Node: A node represents a value in a tree data structure. It contains a value and a pointer to its child nodes.

2. Root: The root is the topmost node of a tree. It has no parent node.

3. Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes in a tree. It represents the relationship between the nodes, such as a parent-child relationship.

4. Parent: A parent is a node that has one or more child nodes.

5. Child: A child is a node that has a parent node.

6. Siblings: Siblings are nodes that have the same parent.

7. Leaf: A leaf node is a node that has no child nodes. It is also known as an external node.

8. Degree: The degree of a node is the number of children it has. For example, a node with no children has a degree of 0, while a node with three children has a degree of 3.

9. Level: The level of a node is its distance from the root node. The root node is at level 0, its children are at level 1, and so on.

10. Path: A path is a sequence of nodes that can be traversed to go from one node to another in a tree. For example, the path from the root node to a leaf node is the sequence of nodes that must be visited to go from the root to the leaf.

11. Internal node: An internal node is a node that has at least one child node. It is also known as a non-leaf node.

12. Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.

13. Height: The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf.

14. Subtree: A subtree is a tree that is formed by selecting a node and all its descendants.
