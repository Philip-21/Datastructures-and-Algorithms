# Queue
 A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
- It is a collection of elements in which elements are inserted from one end called the rear and removed from the other end called the front. 
- In a queue, the oldest element is always at the front and the newest element is always at the rear.

### Advantages 
1. Ordering: The main advantage of a queue is that it follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) ordering principle, which ensures that the oldest element is always processed first. This is important in many applications, such as scheduling processes in an operating system or handling network requests in a web server.

2. Simplicity: Queues are simple data structures that can be implemented easily using arrays or linked lists. This makes them easy to understand and use in programming languages and applications.

3. Efficient Insertion and Removal: Inserting an element at the rear and removing an element from the front of a queue are both constant time operations. This makes queues efficient for many applications that require frequent insertion and removal of elements.

4. Memory Efficiency: Queues use a small amount of memory because they only store the elements in the queue. This makes them ideal for use in memory-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.

5. Synchronization: Queues can be used to synchronize access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. By using a queue to manage access to a shared resource, multiple threads can access the resource in a safe and orderly manner, preventing conflicts and race conditions.

### Diadvantages 
1. Limited Functionality: Queues are limited in their functionality because they only allow access to the front and rear ends of the queue. This means that they cannot be used for applications that require access to other elements in the queue.

2. Slow Access to Middle Elements: Accessing an element in the middle of a queue requires dequeuing all the elements in front of it, which can be inefficient for large queues.

3. Overhead: Queues require additional overhead to manage the front and rear pointers, which can be a performance issue for some applications.

4. Memory Allocation: In dynamic memory allocation, queues can lead to memory fragmentation, which can affect the overall performance of the system.

5. Limited to Single Queue: Queues are limited to a single queue, which means that they cannot be used for applications that require multiple queues or complex data structures.
