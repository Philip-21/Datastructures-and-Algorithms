# Linear Datastructure 
- A linear datastructure are elements that form a sequence or a linear list 

### Linear Array 
 These are elements of the same data type in a list 
- The elements of an array are referenced by index set consisting of n consecutive number
- the elements of the array are stored respectively in successive memory locations i.e  the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and have fixed sizes.
This means that you cannot replace an element in an array with another element of a different size or type, as it would require changing the size of the array and shifting all subsequent elements accordingly.
