# Linear Datastructure 
- A linear datastructure are elements that form a sequence or a linear list 

### Linear Array 
 These are elements of the same data type in a list 
- The elements of an array are referenced by index set consisting of n consecutive number
- the elements of the array are stored respectively in successive memory locations i.e  the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and have fixed sizes.
This means that you cannot replace an element in an array with another element of a different size or type, as it would require changing the size of the array and shifting all subsequent elements accordingly.

#### 1D Array
- A 1-D  array consists of
a fixed number of elements of the same data
type organized as a single linear sequence.

Array Declaration 
syntax = <data_type> <array_name>[<size>]


#### Traversing Linear Array
- In DSA, traversing means to visit and process each element or node of a data structure in a specific order.
- The purpose of traversing a data structure is to access or modify its elements, or to search for a specific element or set of elements.
- To traverse a linear array, you can use a loop that iterates over each element in the array
