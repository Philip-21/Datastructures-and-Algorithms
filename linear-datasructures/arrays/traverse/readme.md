## Travesring
- Traversing a data structure is to access or modify its elements or node, or to search for a specific element or set of elements.
- To traverse a linear array, you can use a loop that iterates over each element in the array

## Problems to Solve 


#### Problem 1
This problem will be implemented using python and go the file will be named as problem1 with their respective file extension.
Suppose we have to count the number of element in an
array or print all the elements of array.
- Steps 
Algorithm 1: (Using While Loop)
1. [Initialize Counter.] Set K = LB.(lower bound)
2. Repeat Step 3 and 4 while K<= UB.(upper bound)
3. [Visit Element.] Apply PROCESS to A[K].
4. [Increase Counter.] Set K = K+1.
[End of Step 2 Loop.]
5. Exit.
