# Linear Datastructure 
- A linear datastructure are elements that form a sequence or a linear list 

### Linear Array 
 These are elements of the same data type in a list 
- The elements of an array are referenced by index set consisting of n consecutive number
- the elements of the array are stored respectively in successive memory locations i.e  the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and have fixed sizes.
This means that you cannot replace an element in an array with another element of a different size or type, as it would require changing the size of the array and shifting all subsequent elements accordingly.

### 1D Array
- A 1-D  array consists of
a fixed number of elements of the same data
type organized as a single linear sequence.

Array Declaration 
syntax = <data_type> <array_name>[<size>]


### Traversing Linear Array
- In DSA, traversing means to visit and process each element or node of a data structure in a specific order.
- The purpose of traversing a data structure is to access or modify its elements, or to search for a specific element or set of elements.
- To traverse a linear array, you can use a loop that iterates over each element in the array

### Insertion in an array 
-  Adds an element at the given index
- Two types of insertion are possible 
1. Insertion at the end of array
2. Insertion in the middle of the array

### Linear Search
- A sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found.
- Linear Search of Un-Ordered data
- Linear Search of Sorted Array

### Deleting in an array
- It Involves removing an element from the given index


## Binary Search
- Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array
- In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array. 
- Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items.

- Limitations Of Binary search
  Although the complexity of Binary Search is
O (log n), it has some limitations:
- The list must be sorted
- One must have direct access to the middle element in
any sublist.
