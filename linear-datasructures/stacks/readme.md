## Stacks 
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) 


#### Advantages of Stacks
1. Simple Implementation :Stacks are simple data structures that can be implemented easily using arrays or linked lists. This makes them ideal for use in programming languages and applications where efficiency and simplicity are important.

2. Memory Efficient : Stacks use a small amount of memory because they only allow access to one item at a time. This means that they can be used in memory-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.

3. Fast Operations: Stacks have fast operations because they only operate on the top item. Pushing and popping an item from a stack is a constant time operation, which makes them efficient for many applications.

4. Function Call Stack: In programming languages, the function call stack is a type of stack that is used to keep track of function calls. This makes it easy to implement recursion and other functions that require the use of a stack.

5. Reverse Order Access: Stacks allow access to items in reverse order, which can be useful in many applications. For example, a web browser's back 


#### Disadvantages of Stacks

1. Limited Functionality: Stacks are limited in their functionality because they only allow access to the top item. This means that they cannot be used for applications that require access to other items in the stack.

2. Stack Overflow: Stacks can overflow if too many items are pushed onto the stack, which can lead to memory errors and crashes in a program.

3. No Random Access: Stacks do not allow random access to items, which means that accessing an item in the middle of a stack requires popping all items on top of it first.

4. Inefficient for Large Data Sets: Stacks can be inefficient for large data sets because they require a lot of memory to store the stack. This can lead to performance issues and slower execution times.

5. Limited to LIFO Order: Stacks only allow access to items in Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order, which can be limiting for some applications that require different orderings of data
